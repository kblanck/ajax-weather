JACKET HOROSCOPE was created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery and can be found at https://kblanck.github.io/jacket-horoscope/.

I pulled current weather data from the free API located at https://openweathermap.org/api. More specifically, I targeted the "feels like" temperature (Fahrenheit), and used if/else statements with temperature parameters to identify what kind of coat the app user might need. It was important to me to keep the options as unisex as possible, so I stayed away from (typically) gendered choices and went with options I thought most folks might have in their winter collection: a puffy coat, a denim jacket, a hoodie, etc.

I collaborated with my sister, visual artist Stephanie Blanck, on the drawings, which I wanted to feel fun, silly, and childlike.

Unsolved problems include the pesky "close" button in the modal div. The button appeared in the down right corner when I tested various devices on the Chrome console, but appeared hanging off the side of the div when I tested the app on my own smartphone. I'd also like to make the errors cleaner (say, if a user enters a zip code that doesn't exist).

In a possible version 2, I'd want to integrate a rain variable, and it'd also be fun to not limit the zip codes to just the United States.
